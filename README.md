# Form validation problem React

From : [Source repository](https://github.com/springload/form-validation-problem)

This version is pretty close to the last one but made with React.

Scaffolding has been made by Yeoman's generator : React Starter Kit.

It has less extraction (services / properties) than the previous one as it was quite heavy on that front.

I have added in-form error labels as it is pretty cheap with a state based mechanism.
to make it simpler I recycled the sentences from the challenge even if they are not user friendly.
